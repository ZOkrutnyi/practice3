#Task3
###1.	Create a WeekDay enum, where day of week corresponds to int value.
      1. Create a console application, that gets one command-line argument:
      	    If the argument is String - just prints whether given day is “working day” or a “weekend”;
      	    If the argument is int - the same as above + prints name of corresponding day of week;
      2. Write a .cmd file, that runs your application several times with following arguments:
      	    Valid input: (String: work day, weekend. Int: work day, weekend) (4 cases)
      	    Invalid input:
      	    String: non-existing day, empty string (2 cases)
      	    Int: smaller than smallest index, bigger, than largest index (2 cases)
      	    Value of type: Double. (1 case)
      	    Wrong number of arguments (zero, more than one).(2 cases)
###2.	Write three methods, that work with upper-bounded, lower-bounded and unbounded wildcards in non-generic class. Write code, that proves their behavior in several cases (comment lines, that don’t compile; add short description for the reason of it in the comment).
###3.	Try to create overloaded function, that differs only by generic parameter (e.g., List<String> and List<Integer>). Does it compile? Why?
